# Population Prediction using Spark and Hadoop

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis, guide, and comparison between two approaches for population prediction using Apache Spark and Hadoop. Both frameworks are widely used for big data processing, but they have different methodologies, strengths, and limitations.

## **1. Apache Spark Approach**

### **1.1 Overview**
Apache Spark is a distributed data processing framework that provides in-memory computing for faster execution. The Spark-based approach leverages PySpark for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.

### **1.2 Steps Involved**
1. **Initialize Spark Session**
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("PopulationPrediction").getOrCreate()
   ```
2. **Load Dataset**
   - The dataset is stored in Google Drive and read using `spark.read.csv()`.
   ```python
   df = spark.read.option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").csv(file_path)
   ```
3. **Preprocess Data**
   - Selects relevant columns related to population data.
   - Drops missing values.
   ```python
   population_df = df.select('Country/Territory', '2022 Population', '2020 Population',
                             '2015 Population', '2010 Population', '2000 Population')
   population_df = population_df.dropna()
   ```
4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Uses `VectorAssembler` to combine multiple feature columns into a single vector.
   ```python
   assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['2020 Population', '2015 Population', '2010 Population', '2000 Population'],
                               outputCol='features')
   data = assembler.transform(population_df)
   ```
5. **Apply Machine Learning Model**
   - Uses `LinearRegression` from Spark MLlib to predict future population.
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
   lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol='features', labelCol='2022 Population')
   model = lr.fit(data)
   ```
6. **Evaluate and Predict**
   - The trained model is used to predict population values for different countries.

### **1.3 Advantages of Spark**
- In-memory processing for faster computations.
- Built-in machine learning library (MLlib).
- Efficient handling of large datasets.

## **2. Hadoop Approach**

### **2.1 Overview**
Hadoop is a distributed storage and processing framework that uses the MapReduce programming model. This approach utilizes the MRJob library to process data and apply machine learning.

### **2.2 Steps Involved**
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Installs `mrjob`, `scikit-learn`, and other required libraries.
   ```python
   !pip install mrjob scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
   !apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk -qq > /dev/null
   ```
2. **Load Dataset using Pandas**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("/content/world_population.csv", sep=";")
   ```
3. **Preprocess Data**
   - Selects relevant columns and removes missing values.
   ```python
   population_df = df[['Country/Territory', '2022 Population', '2020 Population',
                       '2015 Population', '2010 Population', '2000 Population']]
   population_df = population_df.dropna()
   ```
4. **Implement MapReduce Algorithm**
   - Defines a Mapper class that processes data.
   ```python
   from mrjob.job import MRJob
   class PopulationPredictor(MRJob):
       def mapper(self, _, line):
           fields = line.split(';')
           yield fields[0], fields[1:]
   ```
   - Defines a Reducer class that aggregates results and applies machine learning.
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   class PopulationPredictor(MRJob):
       def reducer(self, key, values):
           model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
           yield key, model.predict(X_test)
   ```
5. **Run the MapReduce Job**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       PopulationPredictor.run()
   ```

### **2.3 Advantages of Hadoop**
- Efficient for large-scale batch processing.
- Can handle unstructured and structured data.
- Distributed storage (HDFS) provides fault tolerance.

## **3. Comparison of Spark and Hadoop for Population Prediction**

| Feature             | Spark Approach                         | Hadoop Approach                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Processing Model** | In-memory distributed processing    | Batch processing using MapReduce    |
| **Ease of Use**     | Easier to implement ML models       | Requires defining Mapper & Reducer  |
| **Speed**          | Faster due to in-memory operations  | Slower due to disk-based operations |
| **ML Library**      | Uses Spark MLlib                    | Uses external ML libraries (scikit-learn) |
| **Scalability**    | Highly scalable for real-time analytics | Scalable but optimized for batch jobs |

### **3.1 Key Takeaways**
- **Apache Spark** is preferable when speed is critical, especially for iterative machine learning algorithms.
- **Hadoop** is better suited for handling large-scale batch processing where fault tolerance is essential.
- If the goal is **real-time population predictions**, Spark is the better choice.
- If the goal is **processing huge datasets efficiently over time**, Hadoop is more suitable.

## **4. Conclusion**
Both Spark and Hadoop offer robust frameworks for big data processing and population prediction. The choice between them depends on the specific use case:
- Choose **Spark** for faster, in-memory computations and real-time analytics.
- Choose **Hadoop** when working with large-scale batch data processing with a focus on fault tolerance.

For further improvements, integrating **Spark with Hadoop** (using Spark on YARN) can provide the best of both worlds.
